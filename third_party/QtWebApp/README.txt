QtWebAppLib is a library to develop server-side web applications in C++.
It requires the Qt SDK version 4.7.0 or newer.

License: LGPL v3.

Project homepage:  http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/index.html
Tutorial:          http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/tutorial/index.html
API doc:           http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/api/index.html

There are three demo applications that demonstrate how to use the library.

Demo1 shows how to use the library by including the source code into your
project. This does not depend on the shared library.

Demo2 shows how to link against the shared library.
Build the project QtWebApp to generate the shared library.

Demo3 shows how to use the qtservice component to start the application
as a Windows Service or Unix daemon. Start it with option -h to get help.

I recommend to include the library by source as shown in Demo1 and 3.
