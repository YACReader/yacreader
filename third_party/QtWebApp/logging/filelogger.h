/**
  Logger that uses a text file for output. Settings are read from a
  config file using a QSettings object. Config settings can be changed at runtime.
  <p>
  Example for the configuration settings:
  <code><pre>
  fileName=logs/QtWebApp.log
  maxSize=1000000
  maxBackups=2
  minLevel=0
  msgformat={timestamp} {typeNr} {type} thread={thread}: {msg}
  timestampFormat=dd.MM.yyyy hh:mm:ss.zzz
  bufferSize=0
  </pre></code>

  - fileName is the name of the log file, relative to the directory of the settings file.
    In case of windows, if the settings are in the registry, the path is relative to the current
    working directory.
  - maxSize is the maximum size of that file in bytes. The file will be backed up and
    replaced by a new file if it becomes larger than this limit. Please note that
    the actual file size may become a little bit larger than this limit. Default is 0=unlimited.
  - maxBackups defines the number of backup files to keep. Default is 0=unlimited.
  - minLevel defines the minimum type of messages that are written (together with buffered messages) into the file. Defaults is 0=debug.
  - msgFormat defines the decoration of log messages, see LogMessage class. Default is "{timestamp} {type} {msg}".
  - timestampFormat defines the format of timestamps, see QDateTime::toString(). Default is "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.zzz".
  - bufferSize defines the size of the buffer. Default is 0=disabled.

  @see set() describes how to set logger variables
  @see LogMessage for a description of the message decoration.
  @see Logger for a descrition of the buffer.
