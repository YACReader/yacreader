-------------------
QsLog version 2.1

Changes:
* Allowed checking if a destination of a certain type has already been added.
* Allowed using fprintf instead of OutputDebugString on Windows.
* Made building/running the example from QtCreator easier. Unfortunately I couldn't find a
satisfactory way of doing this using pure qmake, so an env var is needed.
* Added support for CMake builds (Qt5 only, courtesy of A.Gembe).

Fixes:
* Fixed build for Qt < 5.4 (courtesy of P.Hille).

-------------------
QsLog version 2.0

Changes:
* Added possibility to remove destinations.
* Added unit tests for rotation and destination removal.

Fixes:
* Fixed rare codec error in combination with custom ICU.

-------------------
QsLog version 2.0b4

Fixes:
Fixed file name case error for Linux.

Misc:
* Moved to separate git repository.

-------------------
QsLog version 2.0b3

Changes:
* added functor logging destination (thanks to Omar Carey for providing a patch)

-------------------
QsLog version 2.0b2

Changes:
* function signature redefinition for file destination creation
* added shared library build configuration. Credit goes to Xavier Lamien <laxathom@fedoraproject.org>
for the Linux-specific config.
* removed Symbian support
* this version does not guarantee support for Nokia N9 devices, although it should in theory still
work with them
* workaround for Issue 8 - when used from an executable and a plugin QsLog only logs from the
executable.
* utility function to parse the level from an existing log message

Known issues:
* The current version will crash at program exit when using QS_LOG_SEPARATE_THREAD and linking
with QsLog dynamically.

-------------------
QsLog version 2.0b1

Changes:
* destination pointers use shared pointer semantics
* the file destination supports log rotation. As a consequence, log files are encoded as UTF-8 and
the log appends rather than truncating on every startup when rotation is enabled.
* added the posibility of disabling logging either at run time or compile time.
* added the possibility of using a separate thread for writing to the log destinations.

Fixes:
* renamed the main.cpp example to avoid QtCreator confusion
* offer a way to check if the destination creation has failed (for e.g files)
